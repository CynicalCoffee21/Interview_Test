# Interview_Test
An Interview Coding Test. I don't think there are any special requirements for the class. 

Running:
It simply runs via the console and takes an input file formatted like:  [Apple, Orange, ...] 
I created 2 simply test files that can be run with it, or used as a template. 

Part 1 (v1.0)
You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] =&gt; £2.05
● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many
candidates take a list of strings as input

Part 2 (v1.1)
The shop decides to introduce two new offers
● buy one, get one free on Apples
● 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
Update your checkout functions accordingly
